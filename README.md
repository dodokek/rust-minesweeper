# State of project
Minesweeper API is fine, you can use it wherever you want! Alhough, the graphic aspect of the game is raw right now, not all the functions are implemented, there is a lot to do, so **keep tuned**!

## TODO list:
- [x] Remove antialiasing
- [ ] Add starting state, where you can choose the parameters of a minesweeper field
- [ ] Add ending state, where you can try again or give up

# How to run
To play the game you need to run `cargo run --release` in terminal in the project's folder
